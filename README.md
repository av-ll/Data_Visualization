# graphics
Jupyter notebooks and Dataset Countries.csv used in the context of a University course that required
the elaboration of graphical representations.

generate_map_1.ipynb generates a folium map.

Descriptive statistics.ipynb generates figures 2,3,4,5.

metrics_top10.ipynb generates the remaining figures.

names_changed.csv is used in conjunction with generate_map_1 to generate the map as folium requires
names of countries to be consistent with its nomenclature.
